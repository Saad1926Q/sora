There's something ridiculously sweet
about the way a kitten trips over its own feet,
chasing a shadow it'll never catch 
like a tiny, fluffy reminder
that joy doesn't need a reason.

It just happens.

Like laughing too hard over a bad joke,
or the way your favorite song
feels like a warm hug on a rainy day.

Sometimes, the world is soft
in small, unexpected ways,
and that's more than enough.
